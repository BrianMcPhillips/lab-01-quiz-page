            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    The first microphone was invented as a telephone transmitter by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. It was a liquid device that was not very practical. 
                    In 1886, Thomas Alva Edison invented the first practical carbon microphone. The carbon microphone was used for radio transmissions and extensively in 
                    telephone transmitters until the 1970s when they were replaced by piezoelectric ceramic elements.The carbon microphone had a limited frequency range, 
                    and would not reproduce music effectively. In 1916, the condenser microphone was developed by E. C. Wente of Bell Laboratories. The condensor microphone 
                    required an amplifier built within the microphone to pick up the faint signals. Condensor microphones were used for radio broadcasting and the first generation of sound motion pictures.

            <h3>Uses for Microphones</h3>    
                <p>
                    A microphone, colloquially named mic is a device – a transducer – that converts sound into an electrical signal. 
                    Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, 
                    motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, radio and television broadcasting, 
                    and in computers for recording voice, speech re cognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.
